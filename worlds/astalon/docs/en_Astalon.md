# Astalon: Tears of the Earth

<!-- ## Where is the options page?

The [player options page for this game](../player-options) contains all the options you need to configure and export a config file. -->

## What does randomization do to this game?

All key items that appear in your inventory are randomized with the exception of Monster Ball. You can additionally randomize all max health and attack pickups that exist in the world.

White keys, blue keys, red keys, and all switches can be added to the randomized pool. If enabled, picking up keys or hitting switches will complete location checks, and you will receive individual door unlocks or block toggles as items.

You can also randomize all unique upgrades from Epimetheus's shop.

## What is the goal?

The goal is to complete the main Tears of the Earth campaign. New Game Plus is not supported.

## What Astalon items can appear in other players' worlds?

Any items as noted above can appear in other players' worlds depending on which settings you have enabled.

## What does another world's item look like in Astalon?

Items for your world or another Astalon world will appear as the actual item, except for switches, which appear as frogs, and elevators, which appear as the old man's head.

Items for other worlds will appear as a blue orb if they're a progression item, or a grey orb otherwise.

## Are there any unexpected bits of logic the randomizer uses?

- Arias can get more height from jumping while slashing his sword
- There are multiple connections between Mechanism and Hall of the Phantoms
- If you have Blood Chalice you can damage boost through some obstacles
- If you have Icarus Emblem or Talaria Boots you can clear some gaps you otherwise couldn't
- Kyuli's shiring ray attack and Bram's whiplash upgrade can activate Algus's crystal switches
- Banish Spell and the Arcanist upgrade makes Algus's attacks larger, allowing you to hit otherwise inaccessible crystals
- Zeek can get blocks stuck in walls, providing extra height
- Athena's Bell is logically required to fight the final boss
