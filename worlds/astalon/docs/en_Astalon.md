## What does randomization do to this game?

Depending on settings, the following things may be randomized:

- Playable characters
- All key items in your inventory except for Monster Ball
- Health pickups
- Attack pickups
- Keys/doors
  - Collecting keys will complete location checks and you will receive individual door unlocks as items
  - You can enable each color individually
- Switches/magic crystals/faces
  - Activating switches will complete location checks and you will receive corresponding block toggles or door opens as items
- Elevator destinations
- Unique shop upgrades
- Candles

## What is the goal?

The goal is to complete the main Tears of the Earth campaign. New Game Plus and the other campaigns are not supported.

## What Astalon items can appear in other players' worlds?

Any items as noted above can appear in other players' worlds depending on which settings you have enabled.

## What does another world's item look like in Astalon?

Items for your world or another Astalon world will appear as the actual item, except for switches, which appear as frogs, and elevators, which appear as the old man's head.

Items for other worlds will appear as a blue orb if they're a progression item, or a grey orb otherwise.

## Are there any unexpected bits of logic the randomizer uses?

- Arias can get more height from jumping while slashing his sword
- There are multiple connections between Mechanism and Hall of the Phantoms
- If you have Blood Chalice you can damage boost through some obstacles
- If you have Icarus Emblem or Talaria Boots you can clear some gaps you otherwise couldn't
- Kyuli's Shining Ray, Bram's Whiplash upgrade, and Zeek's Magic Block can activate Algus's crystal switches
- Banish Spell and the Arcanist upgrade makes Algus's attacks larger, allowing you to hit otherwise inaccessible crystals
- Algus's Meteor Rain and Zeek's Magic Block can kill ghosts without Banish Spell
- Zeek can get blocks stuck in walls, providing extra height
- Athena's Bell is logically required to fight the final boss on easy difficulty
